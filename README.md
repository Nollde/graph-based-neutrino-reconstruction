This repository has been created for:
* [Poster Contribution ID 738 on the Acat Conference 2021](https://indico.cern.ch/event/855454/contributions/4596736/)
* [IDT-UM Collaboration Meeting Feb 2022](https://indico.physik.uni-muenchen.de/event/166/)

In the jupyter notebook [`neutrino_reco.ipynb`](neutrino_reco.ipynb), we want to take a closer look at how to setup and use a graph based neutrino reconstruction.
